Welcome! These are the dotfiles that I use in my daily-driver Void system. The goal was to build a comfy, minimalist system that doesn't take me out of my workflow. Ever. For that reason I'm using Emacs Keybinds pretty much everywhere. If you don't need/want that, just don't install ~xkeysnail~.

------

*** System Information
- *Distribution*: Void Linux
- *Window Manager*: bspwm
- *Shell*: Bash
- *Terminal*: Urxvt
- *Widgets*: [[https://github.com/elkowar/eww][Eww]]
- *Application Launcher*: [[Rofi][Rofi]]
- *Notification Daemon*: [[https://github.com/lucalabs-de/end][End]]

*** TODOs
- *Write an install script*: It's still a pain to get these dotfiles to run. 
- *Replace xkeysnail with kmonad*: Xkeysnail keybinds don't always work and are hard to debug (also Haskell is cool).
- *Setup i3lock screen*: A blank white screen isn't exactly aesthetic.
- *Fix external monitor setup*: Since I'm using a high DPI notebook it's a pain to use a second (usually low-DPI) monitor. Font and UI size gets all messed up.

** Getting Started
*** Packages
The following is a list of the most important packages I use on my Void installation. Just install their dependencies/build tools as well.
**** From XBPS
~picom~ ~firefox~ ~gtk3~ ~neovim~ ~zathura~ ~rofi~ ~sxhkd~ ~bspwm~ ~i3lock-color~ 
**** From Source
~eww~ ~end~ ~xkeysnail~

*** Firefox Extensions
I'm using my own [[https://github.com/lucalabs-de/key-jump-browser-extension][fork]] of Kenneth Sundqvist's [[https://github.com/KennethSundqvist/key-jump-browser-extension][Key Jump]] extension to allow for keyboard-only navigation in Firefox.

*** Additional Configuration
**** Using template config files
I wanted to be as flexible as possible when it comes to color schemes and dark/light themes, so I'm managing all colors via Xresources. Unfortunately, many programs use their own configuration files for color customization and don't care about Xresources. To get around that limitation, I'm using template versions of these config files which contain placeholders for Xresources colors. I then run a [[.scripts/setup-configs][script]] to fill those placeholders using the corresponding Xresources colors. Files starting with three ___underscores are templates.
**** Disable password prompts when running sudo
Some commands, like ~xkeysnail~ and ~poweroff~ have to be run with ~sudo~, which is a problem if we want to use them in scripts. To avoid being prompted for a password when running these commands, we can add the following line to the ~sudoers~ file, using ~sudo visudo~:

#+begin_src
<USER> ALL=NOPASSWD: <PATH TO COMMAND>
#+end_src

Alternatively, we can create a new file in ~/etc/sudoers.d~ and manage the commands there. To add the most common commands, you can use the following command

#+begin_src bash
  cat <<EOT >> /etc/sudoers.d/nopasswds
  $USER $HOSTNAME = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
  $USER $HOSTNAME = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
  $USER $HOSTNAME = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/wpa_supplicant
  $USER $HOSTNAME = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff
  $USER $HOSTNAME = (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/xkeysnail
  $USER $HOSTNAME = (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/light
  EOT
#+end_src
**** Downgrade rxvt-unicode Version
Version 9.31 of ~rxvt-unicode~ introduced a very annoying bug regarding the terminal prompt. Due to a race condition, the prompt sometimes starts in the middle of the terminal window. This is apparently "intended behaviour" and not subject to [[http://lists.schmorp.de/pipermail/rxvt-unicode/2023q2/002661.html][change]].
My solution is to downgrade the package to version 9.3. Unfortunately, the XBPS repository does not store old releases, so we have to build it from source. I have a separate repository that contains the necessary build config, leveraging ~xbps-src~. Just run the following commands.

#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/lucalabs-de/void-packages
  cd void-packages
  ./xbps-src binary-bootstrap
  ./xbps-src pkg rxvt-unicode
  xbps-install --repository hostdir/binpkgs rxvt-unicode 
#+end_src
